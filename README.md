# AtomicThreatProfile
AtomicThreatProfile is a Python script that creates custom adversary profiles for use in Caldera using json formatted data generated from Control Validation Compass.
Caldera is a cyber security framework designed to easily run autonomous breach-and-simulation exercises, this tool provides great funtionality depending on the use case. However, when using this tool I realised that creating custom adversay profiles can be tedious and saw an oppurtuntity to enhance Caldera with thrat intelligence to generate adversary proflies - this is where Control Validation Compass is useful.
