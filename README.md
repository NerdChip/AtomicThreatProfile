# AtomicThreatProfile
AtomicThreatProfile is a Python script that creates custom adversary profiles for use in Caldera using json formatted data generated from Control Validation Compass.
Caldera is a cyber security framework designed to easily run autonomous breach-and-simulation exercises, this tool provides great funtionality depending on the use case. However, when using this tool I realised that creating custom adversay profiles can be tedious and saw an oppurtuntity to enhance Caldera by automating profile creation 
underpinned by threat intelligence provided by Control Validation Compass.

# Requirements
- Linux 
- Python 3.8+
- Caldera (https://github.com/mitre/caldera)

# Installation 
`git clone https://github.com/NerdChip/AtomicThreatProfile`  
`cd AtomicThreatProfile`  
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 

# Usage 
Before executing Atomic threat profile you will need to retrieve data generated by Control Validation Comapass(CVC). CVC is a great resource that has a number of uses but AtomicThreatProfile only uterlises the Threat Model feature which can be used to categrise potential threats based on motive, location and industy(https://controlcompass.github.io/). This data is what will be passed to AtomicThreatProfile to produce the custom adversary profile within Caldera.

## Select Threat Group
Fill in the one or multiple critera and select a single adversary on the right hand side. For the purpose of this example i have choosen Lazarus Group.

## Copy json Data
After you have chosen an adversary scroll down the page and you will see, Adversary Profile, ATT&CK Navigator Layer (TTPs) and Diamond Model. we will be using the ATT&CK Navigator json data to create the custom adversary profile, click inside the the box and copy the data (ctrl-a & ctrl-c).

## Generate json File 
Once the data has been copied it will be pasted inside a new json file create on the system where Caldera and AtomicThreatProfile are inlsalled. Please remember to create the file in the same working directory as AtomicThreatProfile - Another tip would be to make sure the filename resembles that of the selected threat group. Dont forget to elevate to root priveleges. 

`nano LazarusGroup.json`

## AtomicThreatProfile 
Use -h to invoke help 

`python3 AtomicThreatProfile.py -h`

`usage: AtomicThreatProfile.py [-h] -f FILE -t THREATGROUP [-p PLATFORM]

Python Script that creates custom adversary profiles for use in caldera

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  Name of the saved json file for chosen threat group
  -t THREATGROUP, --threatgroup THREATGROUP
                        Name of the threat group, this is the name that will appear in caldera
  -p PLATFORM, --platform PLATFORM
                        Specifies a platform related to techniques i.e windows, default is all platforms
